           The mission of the Technology Pre-Incubation Cell (TPIC) at Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University is to empower students, innovators, and aspiring entrepreneurs by nurturing early-stage ideas and transforming them into actionable solutions. TPIC provides a structured environment enriched with mentorship, technical resources, training programs, and networking opportunities to bridge the gap between innovation and execution.

Focused on student leadership and collaboration, TPIC supports creative problem-solvers in validating ideas, building prototypes, and preparing for market readiness. It aims to reduce the risks often faced by first-time entrepreneurs and fosters a culture where experimentation and learning from failure are part of the journey.

By cultivating innovation at the grassroots level, TPIC enables students to contribute meaningfully to technology, society, and the economy. The mission is clear: turn potential into progress, and ideas into impact.

           The vision of TPIC is to create a vibrant, student-led innovation ecosystem within HNBGU that fuels creativity, entrepreneurship, and real-world impact. It envisions a future where every student with a promising idea is empowered to explore, build, and lead — regardless of their background or resources.

TPIC aspires to be a recognized hub for grassroots and socially responsible innovation, especially in regional and underrepresented contexts. It aims to cultivate a culture where students are not just learners but active change-makers, addressing challenges through technology and sustainable solutions.

By aligning with national innovation goals, TPIC seeks to contribute to a self-reliant, startup-driven India, while also encouraging responsible innovation across sectors like health, education, environment, and agriculture.

In the long term, TPIC strives to become a launchpad for visionary ideas, a network of mentorship, and a pillar of inclusive growth—all rooted in the spirit and potential of young innovators.
